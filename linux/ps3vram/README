PS3vram by Jim Paris <jim@jtan.com>.

Description
-----------
This is a Linux kernel module to use the extra PS3 GDDR video RAM as
a MTD block device.  It requires MTD block device support in the
kernel (CONFIG_MTD && CONFIG_MTD_BLOCK).  It is not currently very
fast, but could be useful as swap space or additional storage for
LiveCD systems.

It has been tested on the 2.6.16-ps3 kernel (20061110) but should work
on others.

Installation
------------
To build, have your kernel source or headers installed properly and
then run:

  make
  sudo make install

To use it, load the appropriate modules:

  sudo modprobe mtdblock
  sudo modprobe ps3vram

This should create a new block device /dev/mtdblock0.

Using it
--------
The block device behaves like any other disk.  To use it as swap:

  sudo mkswap /dev/mtdblock0
  sudo swapon /dev/mtdblock0 -p 10

To create and mount a filesystem:
 
  sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/mtdblock0
  sudo mkdir -p /mnt/tmp
  sudo mount /dev/mtdblock0 /mnt/tmp

Acknowledgements
----------------
StrontiumDog and urchin for figuring out how to map and use the RAM.
